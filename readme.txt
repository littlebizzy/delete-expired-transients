* [Plugin Homepage](https://www.littlebizzy.com/plugins/delete-expired-transients)
* [Plugin GitHub](https://github.com/littlebizzy/delete-expired-transients)
* [SlickStack](https://slickstack.io)
* [Starter Theme](https://starter.littlebizzy.com)

#### The Long Version ####

No settings page, simply works out of the box. Performs expired transients cleaning periodically and using certain parameters that can be changed using constants:

* Execution period: 6 hours by default (executes 4 times a day), can be replaced by the constant:

    DELETE_EXPIRED_TRANSIENTS_HOURS

(Note: when using the constant it needs to wait for the previous period to end)

* Execution time: By default each process is executed 10 seconds max. This value can be overridden by the constant:

    MAX_EXECUTION_TIME

* Records processed per query: During the execution time, the cleaning process does not retrieve all the involved records, but rather does it in batches of 50. This value can be changed using the constant:

    MAX_BATCH_RECORDS

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

#### Code Inspiration ####

This plugin was partially inspired either in "code or concept" by the open-source software and discussions mentioned below:

* [Disable Emojis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-emojis/)

* [WP Transients Cleaner](https://github.com/pressjitsu/wp-transients-cleaner)
* [Delete Expired Transients](https://wordpress.org/plugins/delete-expired-transients/)
* [Artiss Transient Cleaner](https://wordpress.org/plugins/artiss-transient-cleaner/)
* [Clean Expired Transients](https://wordpress.org/plugins/clean-expired-transients/)

#### Admin Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin "Nag" Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices#Disable_Nag_Notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first one fires during plugin activation which recommends several free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel these notices are too annoying, we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the following defined constant in your `wp-config.php` or `functions.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This will only affect the nag notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices for admin-level users.
